here we're trying to write some tools for cyber security in Rust
because we don't have **enough** community for Rust in the cyber security field soo this project can be use as an example for new coders, or as a small community so feel free to ask anything about Rust here
Also, we will re-write small tools like tomnomnom hacks and after finishing it you will find a simple blog post about **How we write it**



## installation
install rust first from https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install
then replace the TOOL_NAME word in this command with the folder name of the tool you want to install
```bash
$ cargo install --git="https://github.com/knassar702/hacks" TOOL_NAME
```
